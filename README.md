# BigQuery ML Notebooks

Welcome to the "BigQuery ML Notebooks" repository! This repository is dedicated to sharing and collaborating on Jupyter notebooks that utilize Google BigQuery's machine learning capabilities. Whether you're exploring data, building models, or sharing insights, this space aims to serve as a resource for data scientists, analysts, and anyone interested in leveraging BigQuery ML.

## About BigQuery ML

BigQuery ML enables users to create and execute machine learning models in Google BigQuery using standard SQL queries. It brings ML capabilities directly into the data warehouse to allow for seamless integration of ML into data analysis workflows.

## Getting Started

Before diving into the notebooks, ensure you have the following prerequisites covered:

1. **Google Cloud Platform Account**: Ensure you have access to Google Cloud Platform (GCP). You will need it to access BigQuery and run queries.
2. **BigQuery Setup**: Familiarize yourself with BigQuery and ensure your GCP project is set up to use BigQuery.
3. **Jupyter Environment**: Make sure you have a Jupyter environment set up, either locally or through Google Cloud's AI Platform Notebooks.

### Installation

To get started with these notebooks, clone this repository to your local machine or Jupyter environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hitthecodelabs/bigquery_ml.git
```

Navigate into the cloned directory:

bash
```
cd bigquery_ml
```
